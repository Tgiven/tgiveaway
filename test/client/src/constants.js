      headline: "Tracking USPS International Packages",
      subscribe: `USPS international package tracking can be done with a universal tracking solution. GlobalFreight does just that. You can enter your USPS international tracking number on the homepage and after a few seconds, GlobalFreight will give you all the tracking information needed for your package, whether it is domestic or international shipping. The great thing about tracking your USPS international package on GlobalFreight is that you can track up to 10 packages simultaneously.
      
      Although the USPS does have shipment tracking services as part of its operations, packages carried by the USPS are not just handled by the company and are more and more often being delivered by other couriers, subcontracted by the company. Therefore, packages handled by the US Postal Service could be passed over through different couriers as they make their journey to their final destination.

Any number of handlers deliver packages for the USPS, depending on where the package's destination is, as well as the size and weight of a package in certain circumstances. Consequently, the tracking options available from USPS are sometimes lacklustre for individuals and businesses wanting the best possible tracking options for their shipments via the company.

Similarly, you can also get tracking USPS international tracking from their tracking website as well. While you can track up to 35 tracking numbers on the USPS website, separating each tracking number by putting may be a hassle and time-consuming.`,

Another case would be that USPS has received the package but has not scanned the package. Wait a few hours before tracking the package again.

      Also, double-check the tracking number that you have entered. In some cases, a missing or mistyped letter or number could affect the results of the package you're tracking.

      Firstly, check your USPS shipping receipt. This is a common place for the tracking number to be printed. Alternatively, if you made your purchase online, your confirmation email should include the tracking information. If you have already received your package, the tracking number may be printed on the outside of the box or envelope.
      
      In case you are not the sender of the package and need to track it, you can request the tracking number from the sender themselves.
      
      Lastly, if you provided your phone number when you shipped the package, USPS may have sent you a text message with your tracking number.`,
